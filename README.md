VSCODE
CTRL+Ã² to open terminal

$ python --version

This repo has been updated to work with `Python v3.8` and  Python 3.11.4.

## How To Run
1. Install `virtualenv`:
```
$ python -m venv venv
```

2. Open a terminal in the project root directory and run:
```
$ venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Then run the command:
```
$ (venv) python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

4. Then install the dependencies:
```
$ (venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Finally start the web server:
```
$ (env) flask run
```

This server will start on port 5000 by default. You can change this in `app.py` by changing the following line to this:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, port=<desired port>)
```
